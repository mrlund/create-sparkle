# Building Our Community!

- Around the room there are 4 writing prompts. Please complete with your thoughts:
  1. “I feel shy when…”
  2. “I feel most comfortable when…”
  3. “I am most able to be a leader when…”
  4. “Think of a time when you felt the most welcomed and like you belonged. What is one word that describes that feeling?”
- Let’s Make Our Community Agreements! Are any of the answers on our chart papers things you would like to feel or emulate in this classroom? Which ones?

  - What agreements can we create in this class to ensure we create the environment you want?
  - What do we need to respect each other? What does respect look like?

What is one word of intention that you can agree on to make this space safe and an open environment for sharing difficult feelings? Post to the Great Community Wall (GCW)!
